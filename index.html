        In April 1996, the Wiz began play under Head Coach Ron Newman. Led by star midfielder Preki, who earned his first of four career MLS Best XI selections, the inaugural season ended with a elimination in the Western Conference finals. In 1997, the re-christened Wizards finished 21-11 and atop the Western Conference, but surprisingly bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. Preki led MLS in scoring with 41 points and was named League MVP. The route to MLS Cup included what most long-time Wizards fans would name as the most memorable match in club history, a 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Western Conference final, followed by a 1-0 golden goal victory in the “mini-game” immediately following regulation that broke the overall series tie and sent the Wizards on to the Cup. The next three seasons saw the team advance to the postseason, but no silverware was added to the trophy case. 2003 will be most remembered for Preki’s remarkable season at age 40 that garnered him his second league MVP award. In 2004, the Wizards won another of U.S. Soccer’s most coveted trophies, claiming the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup with an overtime win versus the Chicago Fire at Arrowhead with Mr. Hunt in attendance. The Wizards also returned to the MLS Cup final, where they fell 3-2 in dramatic fashion to D.C. United.
